# Kinect-V2-Camera-Calibration-Data  
Camera intrinsics and distortion for Kinect V2 sensor  

I just want to store it somewhere so I don't have to redo the calibration again, so I might as well make it public.   
I couldn't find this info anywhere online, so if this can save someone the hassle of going through the calibration process, you're welcome.

This was generated using the GML Camera Calibration Toolbox I found here:
